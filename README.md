## Particle Information
We are using an Argon Particle device. Particle ID e00fce6885903bb14139f4eb

## Implementation
Our Particle firmware contains four main classes that implement various features of a Smart Home.

All four classes implement the same form of serial command processing using the following methods:
- cmdProcessing() - Receive data from localhost/web server and populate correct variables.
- createStatusStr() - Creates status string to send to localhost/web server.

**CSmartLight** controls the color, brightness, auto/manual, and sleep/wake times on the smart light.
- SmartLight
  - turnOffLight()
  - updateBrightnessManually()
  - updateBrightnessAutomatically()
  - execute() - Checks if time is the wake or sleep time for the light, sets the color of the light based on red, green, blue values from the GUI, then based on the manual or auto setting will control the brightness.

*Smart light response status string variables*: L0(on/off), L1(auto/manual), b(brightness), s(sensor value), M(sensor min), M(sensor max), red, green, blue

**CDoor** simulated controls the open/close status of the door using a photoresistor and sends an alert if the door is open too long.
- CDoor
  - execute() - Checks the status of the photoresistor to open/close the door. More light = closed door, less light = open door. Sends alert if door is open for too long.

*Door response status string variable*: Close, doorProximity, sensorVal

**DHT** Online library from Particle - Adafruit that allows for use of the DHT-11 sensor. Uses the sensor to record temperature and humidity values. We display all our temperature in celcius.
- DHT
  - getHumidty()
  - getTempCelcius()

*DHT response variables*: Humid, Temp

**CThermostat** controls the heating, cooling, and fan simulations as well as its respective power estimation.
- CThermostat
  - execute() - Sets the parameters for heating, cooling, fan and power based on DHT temperature reading.

*Thermostat status response string variables*: heatStatus, coolStatus, fanStatus, power, setTemp

Our power estimation uses the heating, cooling, and fan status to determine the overall watt hour (Wh) for the device.
- Our base power consumption with all features turned off is 100 Wh.
- Heating the smart home is costly and requires 3700 Wh to operate.
- Cooling the smart home is less but still requires 3200 Wh to operate.
- Turning on the fan at any point will cause increase of 500 Wh to the cost.

This results in:
- Heat On / Fan Off = 3800 Wh
- Heat On / Fan On = 4400 Wh
- Cool On / Fan Off = 3200 Wh
- Cool On / Fan On = 3700 Wh
- All Off = 100 Wh

## How to Use
To use the Particle portion of our repository. Change directories into the Particle firmware directory. From there use VSCode + Particle Workbench to Configure the Particle Project, Compile the project code and the Flash the application.

To use the the localhost features of our repository. Change directories into the WebGUI directory. Use the node package manager to install the serial port package. Then use node to start the JavaScript code to spin up the server. Once the GUI is started you can change various settings and values of the particle device using the GUI.

To use the AWS features, follow the instructions in the video and the links on the website along with our server state diagram. Currently, we do not have remote control from AWS to the particle device. We do, however, store all the temperature, humidity, and power data in our database. Because we cannot send commands to the device, the power is not correct on the AWS side (since it depends on the fan setting and other). We are also not displaying the temperature/humidity graphs visually due to issues we were having with the chart.js software we were using
